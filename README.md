# MinimalRepositoryTemplate

This template is designed to streamline the process of setting up a repository or use case within an Xcode project. By leveraging this template, developers can significantly reduce the time and effort required to implement the repository design pattern, which serves as an intermediary layer between the business logic and data storage layers in an application.

The template facilitates the creation of essential components such as Use Cases, Repositories, Local Repositories, and Remote Repositories. Each of these components is pre-configured to align with best practices, ensuring that your implementation of the repository pattern is both efficient and maintainable. This minimal yet powerful template is particularly useful for developers looking to enforce a clean separation of concerns in their projects, enhancing code organization and scalability.
